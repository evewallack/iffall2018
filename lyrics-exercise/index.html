	<h1> DREAMS </h1>

	<h2> FLEETWOOD MAC <br>1977</h2>

	<h3>VERSE </h3>

	<p> 
Now here you go again, you say <br>
You want your freedom <br>
Well who am I to keep you down <br>
It's only right that you should <br>
Play the way you feel it<br>
But listen carefully to the sound <br>
Of your loneliness<br> </p>

<h3> PRE CHORUS </h3>

<p>Like a heartbeat drives you mad<br>
In the stillness of remembering what you had <br>
And what you lost, and what you had, and what you lost <br> </p>

<h3> CHORUS </h3>
<p> Thunder only happens when it's raining <br>
Players only love you when they're playing <br>
Say women they will come and they will go <br>
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know <br> </p>

<h3> VERSE </h3>
<p> Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions <br>
I keep my visions to myself, it's only me <br>
Who wants to wrap around your dreams and, <br>
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell? <br>
Dreams of loneliness, <br> </p>


<h3> PRE CHORUS </h3>
<p> Like a heartbeat, drives you mad <br> 
In the stillness of remembering, what you had,<br> 
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost <br> </p>


<h3> CHORUS </h3>
<p> Thunder only happens when it's raining <br>
Players only love you when they're playing <br> 
Women, they will come and they will go <br>
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know <br> </p>

<h3> CHORUS </h3>
<p> Thunder only happens when it's raining<br>
Players only love you when they're playing <br>
Say, women, they will come and they will go <br>
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know <br> 
You'll know, you will know, you'll know </p>
